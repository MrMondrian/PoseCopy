# Base controller

Startup code for controling Gen3Lite in python. The default CMakeLists.txt file is configured to run python scripts using rospy lib - python integration for ROS. 

## Notes on launch

* Navigate to `scripts` folder and run `chmod +x bug_algorithm_husky.py`, therefore giving execution access to your python script.
* In the `scripts` directory, run `./bug_algorithm_husky --selected-map cafe` to start the controller.
